- Worked as a member of the Load Balancing team, who are responsible for the load balancing solutions used
by Amazon.com, AWS services, and internal tooling in Amazon.
- Designed and developed a new platform to allow our customers to create and manage load balancers (totalling
1,000s of terabytes of throughput per second) with an expectation that the effort required by the customer is low,
including automating the migration to the load balancing platform in a scenario where any downtime was
unacceptable.
- Supported this new platform by being on-call for high severity issues for our largest customers, and working
directly with other Amazon teams to educate them about our platform, and help teams with unique architectures
migrate to our platform safely.
- Deployed our platform to new AWS regions as a foundational service, a process which required co-ordination
with many other teams.
- Automated the build of our platform (and additionally our team’s legacy platforms) for new AWS regions, a
process which saved over one hundred hours of engineer effort per each new region build.
- Mentored new engineers, providing training on the tooling that Software Engineers at Amazon use to write, build,
and deploy code, as well as troubleshoot and manage our team’s services.
